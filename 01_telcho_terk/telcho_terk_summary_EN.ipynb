    "Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that enables systems to **learn from data** without being explicitly programmed. This project elaborates on the following concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Machine Learning (ML)**: Learning patterns from data\n",
    "- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: Systems capable of decision making\n",
    "- **Data Science**: The process of extracting knowledge from data\n",
